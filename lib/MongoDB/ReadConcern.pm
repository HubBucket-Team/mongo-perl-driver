=attr level

The read concern level determines the consistency level required
of data being read.

The default level is C<undef>, which means the server will use its configured
default.

If the level is set to "local", reads will return the latest data a server has
locally.

Additional levels are storage engine specific.  See L<Read
Concern|http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/search/?query=readConcern> in the MongoDB
documentation for more details.

This may be set in a connection string with the the C<readConcernLevel> option.
